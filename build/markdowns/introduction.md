> A Foreground Service for React Native apps, with multiple headless tasks

# Introduction

Forground service that you can use to create an always on Background task in React Native. Foreground service is a kind of service in Android that has a notification that can not be removed until the foreground service is closed, and because of this, you can run a background task with the help of headless JS.

A common use case will be when an app is tracking a user’s location. So with the help of the Headless.js and foreground service, you can keep track of the user’s location even he has killed his app from the recent tasks, of course, if permission is given.
